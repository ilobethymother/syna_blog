          <p>
            When I was a kid, I hated journalists. I thought they were invasive,
            shallow, and loud.<br /><br />
            My consumption of media (Disney shows and horror movies) portrayed
            journalists as apathetic beings uncaring towards others and their
            boundaries. Well, I guess in Hannah Montana, it wasn’t journalists,
            but rather paparazzi; nevertheless, it was all the same. I often
            visualised journalists as vultures, circling around and preying on
            the weak.<br /><br />
            My limited experience with news channels, by that I mean the 5
            seconds of news I saw on the tv when I entered my parents’ room, did
            not stop me from forming an opinion. News was loud, argumentative,
            and grotesque. That was my conclusion.<br /><br />
            As a budding teenager, I was completely removed from anything
            besides myself. My awareness and interest in the world around me
            expanded only in the 11th grade. All credit due to my very chatty
            (and lovely) history and political science teacher. The more I
            learnt about India’s history, the more I learnt about the history of
            the press in India.<br /><br />
            I began to realise just how misinformed I was. Journalism was a form
            of resistance and rebellion. And unlike my childhood beliefs,
            journalists, well, at least the ethical practitioners, were
            principled. Today, as a student in a journalism-adjacent course, I’m
            aware that journalism is “The systematic and reliable dissemination
            of public information, public opinion, and public entertainment by
            mass media communication.”<br /><br />
            India’s evolving journey with journalism began much before the term
            was ever coined, starting with early structured information systems.
            The earliest publications were neither on screens nor paper but
            carved into rocks and pillars. Emperor Ashoka utilised scriptures to
            disseminate royal policies. Under the Mughal rule, official news
            writers, known as Waqia Navis, reported events from provinces to the
            emperor through handwritten newsletters called Akhbars.<br /><br />
            Modern journalism only truly began to take shape after the arrival
            of the British. In 1776, William Bolts was unsuccessful in his
            attempt to publish the first newspaper in India and was shut down by
            the East India Company. The first successful newspaper was published
            in 1780 by James Augustus Hicky.<br /><br />
            His newspaper, The Bengal Gazette, also known as Calcutta General
            Advertiser, was termed as a “weekly political and commercial paper
            open to all parties but influenced by none.”It contained political
            commentary, letters to the editor, scandals, and satire. It
            criticised the colonial government. Hicky was arrested in 1781 for
            his critical writings, and his press was confiscated. Although it
            was short-lived, the Bengal Gazette marked the beginning of
            journalism in India.<br /><br />
            The British soon understood that the very existence of a free press
            in India as a colony would be jeopardised by the potential of the
            free press to mobilise public opinion and disseminate nationalist
            sentiments. The Press Regulations of 1799, the Licensing Act of
            1857, the Vernacular Press Act of 1878, and the Press Act of 1910
            were some of the tough laws that regulated the press in the 19th
            century. In an attempt to curb nationalist passion, the Vernacular
            Press Act focused on publications in Indian languages.<br /><br />
            Yet, the Indian language press grew. The pioneers were the Serampore
            Missionaries with Samachar Darpan, and Raja Ram Mohan Roy with his
            Persian newspaper Mirat-ul-Akbar. Roy stated that his object was to
            lay before the public such articles of intelligence as may increase
            their experience and tend to their social improvement, and to
            indicate to the rulers a knowledge of the real situation of their
            subjects. He later ceased publication in protest against the Press
            Regulations. The Bombay Samachar was founded in 1822.<br /><br />
            The nationalist press grew in strength during the latter part of the
            nineteenth century. Publications such as Kesari, edited by Bal
            Gangadhar Tilak, defied the Government’s attempts to crush
            nationalist aspirations. The Amrita Bazar Patrika began publishing
            in English after the Vernacular Press Act came into force, since the
            Act did not apply to English dailies. In the period 1908-1912, new
            laws such as the Press Act of 1910 granted the Government the power
            to demand a security fee for “offensive matter,” and nearly 1,000
            publications were prosecuted.<br /><br />
            After Independence, the freedom of the press is guaranteed by
            Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, but is liable to “reasonable
            restrictions” by Article 19(2). The Press Council of India was
            established in 1966 as an “autonomous, statutory, quasi-judicial”
            body.<br /><br />
            The Emergency was declared on 25 June 1975 by Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed
            under Article 352(1) on the advice of Indira Gandhi. The civil
            rights were suspended, and the news media were strictly controlled.
            The censors appointed by the government had to scrutinise all news
            articles about the Emergency. In a gesture of silent protest,
            publications such as The Statesman and The Indian Express published
            blank editorials, while The Times of India published a mock obituary
            notice for “D.E.M. O'Cracy.”<br /><br />
            Following the Emergency in 1977, the Indian media restored its
            constitutional protections, and the Press Council of India was
            revamped to uphold press freedom and ethics. Since that time, the
            Indian media has undergone a fundamental change influenced by
            numerous political, legal, and technological elements. India has
            been ranked very low in the World Press Freedom Index, ranking 151
            out of 180 countries in 2025, due to concerns about the decreased
            freedom of the media, legal restrictions, and corporate power.
            Currently, the media face a very challenging situation as new
            avenues for reporting, using digital media, have been accompanied by
            greater competition and the challenge of disinformation. While
            technology has made news more available and provided avenues for
            alternative media, the media face challenges of lawsuits,
            cyberbullying, and editorial restrictions when reporting on
            sensitive issues. The need for regulation in the media industry, the
            use of AI in the media, and court rulings in favour of the freedom
            of the press are some of the issues that the media face in this
            rapidly changing world.
