            What is therapy speak?<br /><br />
            To put it simply, “Therapy speak” is when people use psychological
            phrases and clinical language in their daily lives.
            <br /><br />
            In order to comprehend the dangers of therapy speak, we must
            reconsider the way we discuss language. The purpose and implications
            of a word are just as relevant as its meaning. Paul Grice, a
            linguist and philosopher, was deeply fascinated by implicature— that
            is, not what a statement says but what it communicates without
            explicitly stating.<br /><br />
            Authority-laden speech is a clear example. There is epistemic
            authority in medical speech. If something is referred to as a
            disease, it implies severity and authority. We rarely question
            whether someone has a disease if they'd say they do because we
            assume that the proclamation has come from a medically sound source.
            This authority comes from trusting medical professionals, and there
            are laws preventing us from saying that we are doctors if we do not
            have the required qualifications. Therapy speak works in a similar
            way. Trained therapists are treated as experts in interpreting human
            behaviour, and terms like gaslighting borrow some of that
            authority.<br /><br />
            Problems arise when therapy talk is used outside its proper context.
            Imagine a heated disagreement. Describing it as a heated
            disagreement frames the situation as two people on roughly equal
            footing. Describing it as gaslighting suggests there is little
            chance of the other person being correct and places the speaker on a
            moral high ground. Calling someone a narcissist implies they fall
            into a scientifically designated camp of bad people. In this way,
            therapy language can turn a personal interpretation into something
            that seems objective.<br /><br />
            This connects to concept creep. Alfred Korzybski argued that labels
            can change our perceptions. In his infamous dog biscuit anecdote,
            students who thought they had eaten ordinary biscuits suddenly found
            them repulsive when they learned they were for dogs. Labels do more
            than describe reality; they can shape it. Calling someone a
            narcissist or an event gaslighting abstracts behaviour into a fixed
            identity, which can distort reality. The terms narcissist or
            gaslighting are commonly used on social media for anyone a person
            disagrees with or for events that don’t fit the original
            descriptions. Over time, this can dilute the meaning of terms that
            are genuinely useful.
            <br /><br />
            Therapy speak also carries ethical assumptions. Kevin R. Smith
            explains that therapy carries ideas about what makes a good life.
            Some see therapy as fixing abnormal symptoms, others as
            self-knowledge, and others as addressing social or environmental
            circumstances. Popular therapy speak often emphasises extreme
            individualism, viewing people as isolated agents. Discussions of
            burnout online often reduce it to personal boundaries, ignoring
            social and economic pressures such as housing or inherited values
            about work and achievement. Relationship advice prizes independence
            while minimising duty or compromise.<br /><br />
            Therapy language can also signal moral virtue. Using terms correctly
            is often seen as a sign of good character. This presents a value
            system as objective. Yet even among therapists, these ethical
            frameworks vary. Popular therapy speak assumes its individualistic
            ethic is universal, hiding its subjective basis.<br /><br />
            This phenomenon is not limited to therapy. Language more broadly can
            borrow authority or obscure values. Scientific or statistical
            language can be misleading. Abstract terms like enhanced
            interrogation or pacification can hide what is happening on the
            ground. As with therapy speak, abstraction can make subjective
            perspectives appear objective. Recognising this helps us approach
            mental health, politics, relationships, and scientific reporting
            with critical awareness. It is essential to recognise the tools that
            deceive us so that we can be cautious about the information we
            consume.<br /><br />
