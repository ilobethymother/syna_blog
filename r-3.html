            This analysis examines the news article “Sakhi auto service by
            women, for women’ launched in Bengaluru” published by The Hindu,
            which entails the launch of Sakhi, an auto aggregator service
            exclusively for women, which started its operations in Bengaluru on
            February 14. The auto aggregator service has inducted 50 autos
            driven by women and will take orders only from women passengers. The
            service will make travelling in autos stress-free for women.<br /><br />
            <h2><b>Categorisation</b></h2><br>
            The news is event-based and it highlights the launch of a new
            service, the fares, booking, number of people being onboarded, and
            the plan to develop an app in the future. The news is, however,
            linked to the problem of women’s safety and anxiety when travelling.
            <br /><br />
            <h2><b>Who is Affected</b></h2><br />
            Women passengers, especially those travelling during late hours, are
            directly affected. Women auto drivers working in a male-dominated
            sector are also affected. Existing ride-hailing platforms such as
            Namma Yatri, Uber, and Ola may be indirectly affected.<br /><br />
            <h2><b>Who is Quoted</b></h2><br />
            Vinutha, a woman auto driver Amruta P.,<br />
            a law student Krishnavi Parekh,<br />
            founder of the start-up Jaya Rajeev, a resident of Bengaluru
            <br /><br />
            The quotes match the issue. A driver speaks about misbehaviour by
            male passengers. A passenger speaks about stress and caution while
            travelling. The founder explains why the platform was started. A
            resident raises concerns about availability and acceptance.
            <br /><br />
            <h2><b>Summary of the Report</b></h2><br />
            Sakhi, an auto aggregator exclusively for women, was launched in
            Bengaluru on February 14. The service has so far enlisted 50 autos,
            driven by women only. The initiative was launched to make travel a
            comfortable and stress-free experience for women. Only women are
            allowed to place orders for the service.<br /><br>
            Vinutha, who has been driving an auto for two years, said that there
            have been instances where she has been harassed by male passengers.
            She was thrilled to be a part of Sakhi, which offers women auto
            services driven by women, for women.<br />
            A law student from Bengaluru said that although she has not faced
            any issues during her late-night auto rides, there is always some
            stress and caution in the back of her mind. She always makes sure
            someone tracks her live location. Platforms like Sakhi are seen as a
            stress-free option.<br /><br>
            Founder Krishnavi Parekh said women feel the need to stay alert
            whenever they are travelling and that it was long overdue to get rid
            of that anxiety. While some residents raised concerns about driver
            availability, the founder said the response has been good so far.
            The team plans to launch an app within a month.
