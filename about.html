              <p>Hi! I’m Syna, the author of this blog.</p>

              <p>
                I’ve grown up shuffling between Delhi and Mumbai, and I’m
                currently in Bengaluru for college (I’m collecting metropolitan
                cities like Pokémon). I’m pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in
                Psychology and Communication Media at Christ University.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now, Google tells me to state my core values, which feels
                slightly corporate for someone who still panics over submission
                portals. However, I value empathy and honesty, and have an
                unending desire for growth.
              </p>

              <p>
                This blog was birthed as a class assignment for my course
                “Report Writing and Editing.” Which means that every single atom
                of this website is essentially a (hopefully articulate and
                structured) plea to my professor for marks. BUT —I did enjoy the
                process of its creation, at least when I wasn’t crying.
              </p>

              <p>
                Beyond this assignment, the entire course has genuinely pushed
                my growth, which if you remember I highly value. It mandated me
                to get out of my comfort zone and interview people. It made me
                realise how surface-level my everyday interactions used to be. I
                do not mean with family or friends, but with the shopkeepers at
                the chai stalls I frequent or the college guard who sees me
                sprinting to class every morning.
              </p>

              <p>
                If not for this course, I'm not sure if I would have ever
                stopped to converse with them. Which would be such a shame
                because the insight I have gained and the stories I have heard
                are immeasurable.
              </p>

              <p>
                I also recognised that the way I used to question the world was
                shallow. I never really read the news before this. If I ever on
                the off chance have a newspaper in hand I would flip straight to
                the comic section. Now I can read an entire paper without zoning
                out. I find myself immersed, curious, and analysing what I read
                instead of passively consuming it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Somewhere between deadlines and drafts, this course did not just
                teach me how to write reports. It taught me how to pay attention
                to the world that surrounds me.
