          <p style="color: black">
            In January 2021, when the pandemic was escalating, 12-year-old
            Maryam Jameela, together with her father and brother, came up with
            an inspiring grassroots movement, “The Neighbourhood Library”.<br /><br />
            Maryam, who had always been an avid reader since childhood, thanks
            to her father’s bookstore, realised that children were being raised
            with more screen time than book time. She, along with the help of
            her father, Mirza Abdul Qayyum Nadvi, and brother, Mirza Abdul Hasan
            Ali, decided to do something for the kids in their area to instil a
            love for reading in them.<br /><br />
            The first libraries were established in almirahs with 300 to 400
            books in parking lots, mosques, temples, and residential lawns.
            Today, the movement has expanded to 36 libraries in Aurangabad, and
            more in Hyderabad, parts of Madhya Pradesh, and Kashmir.<br /><br />
            According to Ali, the movement was started without any expectations,
            only with the hope that children would have something to read.
            However, over five years, the libraries have brought about a marked
            change, especially in the area of leadership training. In some
            areas, children have come forward on their own to manage the
            libraries as “young librarians.” Without any staff members, these
            children are in charge of managing the books and lending them out.
            Plans are afoot to give them a small salary every month and training
            in basic record-keeping to give them confidence. The movement
            specifically encourages girls, including Muslim girls, to take up
            this task as a step towards empowerment.<br /><br />
            Talking about the library as an open, free, and inclusive space, Ali
            said, “The library is for marginalised groups, especially children
            and Muslim women. Incidents such as the removal of a woman’s hijab
            in public send a negative message to society and discourage women.”
            He further added, “It creates fear and uncertainty among
            marginalised groups who are already under constant social pressure.
            This initiative aims to provide access to books, opportunities, and
            a safe space every day to slowly work towards reducing the fear of
            exclusion and encourage participation with confidence.”<br /><br />
            The team plans to establish 26 additional libraries this year in
            collaboration with communities, NGOs, and individuals. However,
            securing space remains a huge difficulty, as the initiative does not
            pay rent and relies on residents willing to provide modest spaces
            for libraries. Staffing is also limited due to a lack of
            institutional funding, with most centres maintained by volunteers,
            including close friends and local supporters. Though not a
            registered NGO, the project continues as a community-driven effort,
            with hopes of formalising hiring and training processes if funding
            becomes available.<br /><br />
            Each library houses children’s literature, picture books, and
            biographies in Marathi, Hindi, Urdu, and English. The library
            remains open 24/7 and without locks; the libraries operate on mutual
            trust within the community. Ali acknowledged that some books may be
            damaged or lost, but this was part of the process of maintaining
            access without restriction. He also pointed out that the collection
            is made up mainly of inexpensive children’s books, and that the
            overall goal is to achieve justice in access.<br /><br />
            Using his experience in social work and with UNICEF in the area of
            child protection and mental health, Ali has strived to make the
            libraries a safe and welcoming environment. The project has now been
            extended to over 10,000 children. Children who once lacked access to
            books have gone on to confidently speak with journalists from
            outlets such as Aaj Tak and BBC. Ali said the collective growth in
            children’s confidence and curiosity stands as the project’s greatest
            success.<br /><br />
            He added that communities need not wait for large organisations to
            act. Even a small shelf of books, he said, can become the foundation
            of change if communities are willing to adopt, critique, and expand
            the idea themselves.
