          compromised by today's media houses?

          <p>
            When an individual with no professional journalistic training
            becomes a journalist, ethical guidelines are simply absent. In
            today’s digital landscape, one can instantaneously create and spread
            content. The ability to publish has never been more accessible, and
            consequently, the responsibility that comes with it has never been
            more diluted. Journalism has to seek the truth, elevate unheard
            voices, and publish well-tested facts. However, the average person
            does not understand the weight of addressing a large audience.<br /><br />
            Nonetheless, blaming only citizen journalists would be redundant.
            Media companies are facing unprecedented structural pressure. The
            digital revolution has transformed the news production process. Now,
            news must be produced consistently without interruption. Editorial
            objectives are increasingly driven by profit and engagement. In this
            race to stay relevant, accuracy and objectivity are left behind,
            accountability is lost, and autonomy is diminished.<br /><br />
            The principle of minimising harm is staggeringly affected.
            Minimising harm exists in a more nuanced space. Its boundaries tend
            to overlap with other principles, making it difficult to enforce or
            measure. “Minimising harm” is one of the elements of the
            professional codes of ethics. It states that sources, subjects,
            colleagues, and members of the public shall be treated as human
            beings deserving of respect as well as showing heightened
            sensitivity toward juveniles, victims of sex crime, and individuals
            who are inexperienced or incapable of consenting. Minimising harm
            poses essential questions: do we disclose information simply because
            it is interesting?<br /><br />
            The ethics of journalism are something journalists are required to
            consider with every story they produce. It is not a duty of
            journalism to share videos in which people are harmed or suffer. At
            no point should any news organisation intend to invade an
            individual’s privacy, defame the activities of a person, or mislead
            others into harm.<br /><br />
            A journalist's duty is to inflict as little harm as possible. They
            must remain careful when looking for or using pictures or
            conversations with those who encountered tragedy. They must
            understand that obtaining and publishing information can cause pain.
            They must avoid catering to morbid curiosity, show caution in
            identifying sex offence victims or juvenile suspects, and avoid
            naming criminal suspects until legal charges are filed. Furthermore,
            they must strike a balance between a suspect’s right to a fair trial
            and the public’s right to be informed.<br /><br />
            Think of a local paper that says in a bold headline, “ICE is here,”
            even if the article then subsequently specifies that the operation
            may only affect a few people. Only a handful get past the headline.
            Such framing causes panic and fails to reduce harm.<br /><br />
            The consequences of journalistic harm, even if unintentional, are
            dire. In harassment cases, a small group of people are responsible
            for the abuse while most remain unaware. However, wide media
            coverage can magnify the problem. This is why the phrase “don’t feed
            the trolls” exists. While people become more aware, the number of
            people engaging in harassment also increases, causing victims more
            agony. By exposing wrongdoing, journalism may polarise and
            exacerbate the harm of the act.<br /><br />
            Journalists will often present two opposing views as equally valid,
            even when the evidence strongly supports one side. For instance,
            placing a climate scientist and a climate denialist in the same
            article and providing credence to both sides by presenting their
            perspectives as carrying the same weight is misleading. The
            conclusions drawn by a scientist are backed by research, data, and
            peer review, while the denialist relies on opinion. Portraying the
            two as balanced viewpoints is harmful to the public
            understanding.<br /><br />
            Similarly, giving extremists a platform under the guise of debate
            can disseminate harmful ideas to impressionable audiences.
            Newspapers were the main entry point for public discussions in
            earlier times. Today, the Internet is already providing extremists
            with notable visibility. When mainstream media raises these voices
            further “for the sake of balance”, they risk allowing the louder
            voices to dominate. Religion, immigration, and minority coverage are
            affected by this distortion. When the media concentrates more on
            extremist elements, it skews public perception away from reality.<br /><br />
            Newspapers must acknowledge the enormity of the harm produced by the
            way they function. They may not have caused the harm, but they play
            a significant role in perpetuating and supporting the damage.
            Newspapers do not exist in a vacuum anymore, given the fact that
            there are now multiple means through which an individual can express
            themselves and dominate public discourse. It is no longer enough to
            "bring every side to the table," especially when some sides are
            already overpowering others.
