            “The meaninglessness of suffering, not the suffering, was the curse
            that lay over mankind so far.” Nietzsche writes that man does not
            deny suffering — he wills it, even seeks it out, provided he is
            given a meaning for it. If pain has a purpose, it becomes bearable.
            If it does not, it becomes unbearable. This idea feels uncomfortably
            relevant when thinking about how sadness is treated in art and
            online culture.<br /><br />
            Mina Le once discussed how Tumblr made being sad feel essential to
            being interesting. Sadness wasn’t just an emotion. It was depth. It
            was personality. Mental illness was aestheticised, and sadness was
            conflated with creativity.
            <br /><br />
            So if art glamorises suffering and mental illness, is it moral to
            create it?
            <br /><br />
            In ‘On the Genealogy of Morality’, Nietzsche makes the case that
            cruelty used to be enjoyable to people. He contends that people have
            always enjoyed cruelty because it stems from archaic social
            contracts that required an eye for an eye in return for any harm.
            Public executions and tortures served as entertainment. But as
            society became “civilised,” those instincts had to be regulated. The
            pleasure in cruelty did not disappear. It turned inward. Guilt and a
            bad conscience were born. We internalised punishment. We became
            cruel to ourselves. Enjoyment from punishing others was redirected
            into enjoyment from punishing ourselves.<br /><br />

            Journalism has to be objective. Journalism has to be neutral.
            Activism doesn’t.<br /><br />
            Viktor Frankl, in ‘Man’s Search for Meaning’, states something
            similar. He claims that suffering ceases to be suffering when it
            finds meaning. In a concentration camp, what haunted him was not
            survival itself but whether the dying around him had meaning. If
            suffering had no meaning, survival itself felt pointless. Art and
            personal expression can operate similarly: they provide meaning to
            damage. BoJack Horseman’s “Good Damage” episode illustrates this:
            Diane believes her trauma must produce a profound memoir, or it
            remains mere damage. The idea of “good damage” reframes suffering as
            valuable when it generates meaning or insight.<br /><br />
            In ‘Girl, Interrupted’, Susanna Kaysen is suicidal, but she is
            attractive, poetic, and romantically pursued. In American Horror
            Story, Tate instructs Violet on how to injure herself severely, and
            viewers romanticise their relationship. <br /><br />
            Some studies appear to support the “troubled artist” trope. Ludwig
            (1995) and Post (1994) found high rates of psychiatric difficulty
            among writers and artists. But definitions of “creativity” and
            “mental illness” vary wildly. More research suggests that mentally
            ill individuals may be drawn to art as catharsis, not that illness
            makes them inherently more creative.<br /><br />
            Psychological research also explains the appeal of sad art. Hedonic
            motives suggest that sad music can feel beautiful or calming.
            Self-verification theory suggests that people seek emotions that
            confirm their existing self-concept. For depressed individuals, sad
            music may reinforce a negative self-schema. For others, it may
            simply reflect a temporary mood.<br /><br />
            This complicates the morality of sad art.
            <br /><br />
            Sad art can provide catharsis. It can help people feel less alone.
            It can offer nostalgia or calm. But it can also reinforce harmful
            identities, especially when sadness becomes aspirational.<br /><br />
            The romanticisation of illness is not new. In the 1800s,
            tuberculosis was aestheticised as the disease of the beautiful,
            fragile artist — the “faded flower.” Once medical knowledge advanced
            and the mystery disappeared, so did the charm. Today, physical
            illness is demystified. Mental illness still carries mystery, and
            mystery leaves room for aesthetic projection.
            <br /><br />
            Maybe as knowledge increases, the romanticism will fade.
            <br /><br />
            In the end, context and interpretation determine whether tragically
            beautiful work is morally acceptable. Suffering does not impart
            creative excellence, nor is pain intrinsically good. When art
            addresses pain in an ethical way, it recognises human frailty rather
            than glorifying it. While sadness is an unavoidable and significant
            emotion, pursuing it as a style or identity choice can inadvertently
            promote unhealthy beliefs. Thus, its effect, especially on
            susceptible and vulnerable audiences, needs to be examined.
