            Bengaluru: The pet cafés in Bengaluru function in a planned manner
            with respect to hygiene and monitoring of behaviour to ensure the
            safety of the animals, according to a staff member of a
            Bengaluru-based pet café.<br /><br />
            Ashwin Morris (40), manager, said, “The first difference between a
            café and a pet café is the sense of responsibility. Hygiene is more
            than a routine,” he said, adding that the feeding bowls, toys,
            leashes, and water dispensers are cleaned two to three times a day
            depending on usage and are cleaned immediately if they get dirty.
            The place also undertakes heavy cleaning and sanitising of the area
            twice a day. There is a five-member cleaning staff who disinfect the
            area where the dogs move, play, and sleep.<br /><br />
            The staff members also pointed out that monitoring of behaviour is
            an important part of the functioning of the café. Rahul Alfred
            Winston (27), a staff member, said that the dogs are closely
            monitored to avoid distress, overexcitement, or aggression. “Their
            behaviour can change suddenly,” he said, adding that the staff are
            trained to recognise early warning signs. Although regular visitors
            become accustomed to the surroundings, some dogs exhibit signs of
            anxiety, especially when parted from their owners. Careful
            interaction is ensured to minimise stress.<br /><br />
            The café has a systematic intake process before agreeing to board
            any dog. Pet owners are required to bring their dogs for the first
            encounter, followed by a short experience at the daycare. This
            allows the staff to evaluate the dog’s temperament, level of
            anxiety, and adaptability to the surroundings before finally
            allocating boarding information.<br /><br />
            The centre is operational 24/7, with an on-call veterinarian in case
            of emergencies. Minor biting cases are handled by the staff, while
            those requiring medical attention are referred to a veterinarian.<br /><br />
            Morris states that the most challenging part of running the café is
            dealing with unpredictable behaviour while also keeping pet owners
            informed. While cleaning and sanitation follow a fixed routine, dogs
            can react differently depending on their mood and surroundings. He
            said the staff have to stay alert at all times to ensure the safety
            of both the animals and visitors, making supervision just as
            important as hygiene in the functioning of the café.
