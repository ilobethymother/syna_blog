            Can journalism coexist with activism and advocacy without
            compromising on the ethics of objectivity?<br /><br />
            Most reporters would laugh at the absurdity of the question, as they
            deem true journalism incompatible with activism. However, as the
            world shifts, the lines between the two blur, making the initially
            theoretical question an important point of discussion.
            <br /><br />
            If journalism were to be personified, it would be a circus
            performer, walking on a thin tightrope, in heels. To the right of
            the fraying rope lies advocacy, to the left, activism. As journalism
            treads on this unstable line, the spectators demand a declaration of
            its allegiance, while all that awaits below is the risk of losing
            credibility.<br /><br />
            But what exactly does this mean?<br /><br />
            Journalism is described as "the collection, preparation, and
            distribution of news and related commentary and feature materials
            through print and electronic media" by the Merriam-Webster
            dictionary. Journalism closely adheres to the core principles of
            truth and accuracy, fairness and impartiality, independence,
            humanity, and accountability.<br /><br />
            Journalism has to be objective. Journalism has to be neutral.
            Activism doesn’t.<br /><br />
            The Cambridge dictionary defines activism as, “The use of direct and
            noticeable action to achieve a result, usually a political or social
            one.” Activists do not aim to reflect alternative viewpoints; they
            aim to mobilise a like-minded audience to bring about desired
            change. When journalists become emotionally or politically invested,
            they compromise their ability to remain impartial. The principle of
            objectivity, if entirely abandoned, would make journalism
            indistinguishable from public relations and marketing. <br /><br />
            Advocacy, however, occupies a more ambiguous space. At its core,
            advocacy pertains to pleading another's cause or arguing in support
            of an idea, event, or person. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED)
            defines it as 'verbal support or argument for a cause, policy, etc.’
            Advocacy operates through persuasion, whereas activism prefers
            direct action. <br /><br />
            ut what happens to these distinctions when human rights and areas of
            public interest are concerned? When reporting sensitive subjects
            that push a journalist's professional boundaries, is it really
            possible for them to maintain objectivity and impartiality? Is it
            feasible to accept "both sides" of an argument with a white
            supremacist, someone who has morally repugnant and unscientific
            beliefs about what it means to be human? However, the media risks
            becoming propaganda megaphones for the powerful when neutrality is
            completely abandoned.<br /><br />
            It is crucial to note that due to journalism’s selective nature,
            advocacy can surface in subtler ways, causing some voices and issues
            to be promoted or ignored more aggressively than others.
            Journalists, much like all individuals, carry preconceptions
            influenced by their social, political, and cultural backgrounds.
            These assumptions along with factors, including the media’s profits,
            difficulties in filtering out personal values or bias, and the rise
            of the digital revolution, heavily affect objectivity and
            credibility.<br /><br />
            With the progression of the digital revolution, the concept of
            objectivity has gradually faded. Journalists utilise objectivity as
            a tool only when it results in profits. When being more sensational
            and taking sides will bring them more viewers, they opt to disregard
            guiding principles. If the ultimate purpose of journalism is
            anything other than the pursuit of truth, the role of the media
            risks changing from informative to propagandistic.<br /><br />
            There is reasonable concern that activism will corrupt the core
            values of journalism. The problem rests not in journalists caring
            for causes but in the rejection of ethical standards. Journalism is
            inherently linked to advocating for truth and public interest, but
            it must ensure that this advocacy does not harden into the
            perpetuation of a single point of view or fall into extreme
            activism.<br /><br />
